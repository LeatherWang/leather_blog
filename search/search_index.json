Features \u00b6 More robust and fast relocalization. Less resource consumption with amcl instead of global icp. Support three initial pose source: 1) user define, 2) visual loop closure, 3) global icp. Handle kidnap with dynamic amcl generation. Handle dynamic obstacles influence in pose graph. Higher repeat localization accuracy than only AMCL used. Enhanced Cartographer Mapping with Gyro Factor and Visual Loop Closure \u00b6 Done by leatherwang on 2021-03-10. Features \u00b6 Less rotation drift with gyro factor in pose graph optimazation. Online timeoffset solution between gyroscope and 2d lidar. Less resource consumption with low frequency inter constraint constructed by visual loop closure.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-leatherwangs-blog","text":"","title":"Welcome to leatherwang's Blog."},{"location":"#enhanced-cartographer-pure-localization-with-amcl","text":"Done by leatherwang on 2021-04-25.","title":"Enhanced Cartographer Pure Localization with AMCL"},{"location":"#features","text":"More robust and fast relocalization.
